                  We all love food and friends, right? But what happens every time we try to mix the two? INDECISIVENESS! 
                  I’ve lost count of the times I’ve gone back and forth with my significant other about agreeing on a place to chow down. 
                  With my app that struggle will soon be a thing of the past. This app can be used by anyone, regardless if their taste is simple or complex, 
                  by groups of any size, people with dietary restrictions or all out gluttons. Whether you’re looking for a quick bite 
                  or trying to go all out for an evening of drinks at a five-star restaurant, FeastQuest will serve you well.
              </p>

              <h6>User will be asked simple questions towards what kind of experience they’re seeking:</h6>

              <ul id="items" class="list-group">
                <li id="answerA" class="list-group-item"> How many guest are looking to dine? </li>
                <li id="answerB" class="list-group-item"> Would you like to dine-in or take-out? </li>
                <li id="answerC" class="list-group-item"> What type of food (Mexican, American, Italian, etc.) is your party interested in at the moment? </li>
              </ul>
              <br>
              <p>
                Once the users have complete the form, FeastQuest will search for options within a defined perimeter of the user’s location. 
                This will be done through Google’s “Places” API. Then the options gathered will be given to the user to pick from. 
                All selections will be pooled into a database to help users make more precise decision in the future. FeastQuest will even 
                give a “Select Random” button for extra indecisive users to relinquish all decision making and leave their stomach in the hands of fate.

                        During this homework I spent a lot of my time trying to revamp my website from the template form that we worked on in class. I had probably gone through about 2 or 3 different designs before settling on the final design that I’ve submitted. I still have plenty of polishing to do, and who knows if this design will be the same come the end of the course. 
                        In my original templet I was trying to do slanted boxes where the background content would scroll under. Then I wanted to implement javascript code that would take the slanted box and merge it with the top of the webpage. My idea was to create a nice profile with my name and picture at the top of the page while the rest of my projects and blog post would be accessible.  
                       </p>

                       <p class="lead my-3">
                        I ended up finding some code to make a vertical scrolling webpage. But I was still pretty set on my slanted box format that I was working on before. I ended up merging to two concepts where I put my slanted boxes inside the bordered boxes in the vertical scrolling concept.

                       <img src="../images/third.png" >

                       <p>
                        Changing to this web design meant that I wasn’t able to use the javascript code that I had been previously working on. I began to brainstorm what I could do to implement any kind of code. As someone that really enjoys movies, I decided it might be a fun idea to add some movie references through the implementation. My mind went straight to a favorite of mine, The Matrix. In my implementation, I decided to as two buttons at the end of my webpage. One button would be “the red pill” and the other “the blue pill.”
                       </p>

                       <img src="../images/redOrBlue.png" >

                       <p>
                        When clicking the red pill an eventListener calls the function goDownTheRabbitHole. This function gives the user an alert saying “The Matrix has you…” then changes the web page’s background to a gif of the iconic drizzling green numbers (aka “The Matrix). 
                       </p>

                       <img src="../images/matrixHasYou.png" >
                       <img src="../images/enterTheMatrix.png" >

                       <p>
                        On the alternative to “taking” the red pill, if you click the blue pill you’re ultimately deciding to conform to the rules of society, which I show through a reference to John Carpenter’s “The Live.” Much like the other button this button has an eventListener that calls allOutOfBubbleGum. This function has the same process as The Matrix functions but changes the background to the subliminal messages that can be seen in They Live after putting on the truth sunglasses. 
                       </p>
